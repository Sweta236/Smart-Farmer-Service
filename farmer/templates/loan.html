          banks and other lenders in India.</p><h4><strong>On The Basis of Loan Tenure</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Crop Loan/ Kisan Credit Card
          (Retail Agri Loan): </strong>Kisan Credit Card/ Kisan Card is an ideal agriculture loan option to meet short term credit requirements,
          such as expenses resulting from cultivation of crops, post-harvest activities, maintenance of farm equipment, etc. The card is generally
           available in the form of an electronic RuPay Card, which the farmers can use to draw money from ATMs to make the required purchase. Thus, it
           provides convenient credit to meet your daily farm requirements.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More: </strong>

            </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Agriculture Term Loan: </strong>This refers to the long term loans of up to 48 months offered by various
             lenders to meet agricultural expenditures that are generally not seasonal in nature. The loan amount can be used to purchase new
              machinery or upgrade existing ones, install solar power, windmills, etc. Banks generally allow
          repayment tenure of 3 to 4 years for this loan, so that you can pay back the borrowed amount back in monthly/bi-annual/yearly installments
           as per the borrower’s convenience.</li></ul><h4><strong>On The Basis of End Use</strong></h4><ul><li>

           <strong>Farm Mechanization Loan: </strong>This loan can be used to purchase new machinery, repair/ replace old ones, purchase tractors or
            harvesters, or any other agricultural equipment. While some banks provide a general purpose loan, others have categorized these loans
            into different types based on the end-use. For example, State Bank of India offers tractor loans, combine harvester loans and loans for
             irrigation equipment.</li><li><strong>Solar Pump Set Loan: </strong>This agricultural loan is offered for the purchase of photo voltaic
             pumping system for small irrigation projects. It is generally a long term loan with repayment tenure of up to 10 years.</li><li>

             <strong>Loan for Allied Agricultural Activities: </strong>This loan is offered to farmers to meet working capital requirements and long
              term investment needs for allied agricultural activities.</li></ul><h4><strong>Other Loan Types</strong></h4><ul><li>

              <strong>Horticultural Loan:</strong> This agricultural loan is given for development of the land for setting up orchards or vegetable
              farms, clearing of undergrowth or wild trees, minor irrigation activities, setting up boundary walls / fencing and other horticultural
              reasons.</li><li><strong>Agricultural Gold Loan:</strong> This loan is provided to farmers against the pledge of gold ornaments.
              It may be offered for crop cultivation as well as for other agricultural purposes. This loan features relatively low interest rates
              and helps farmers unlock the value of their gold jewellery that is usually lying idle in the house or bank locker.</li><li>
              <strong>Forestry Loan:</strong> This agricultural loan is given for raising crops that grow on trees. Like horticulture loans,
              it can be given to clear the undergrowth or wild trees, turn barren land into cultivable land, prepare land by setting up irrigation
              channels, and so on.</li></ul><p><strong id="Eligibility">NOTE: </strong>Borrowers should keep in mind that each bank offers different
              agricultural loans for varied needs. These products differ on criteria such as

              <a href="https://www.paisabazaar.com/personal-loan/eligibility-calculator/">eligibility</a>, margins, collateral, interest rates,
              tenure, etc. Hence, we advise you to contact the specific lender to know more about the loan product.</p>
